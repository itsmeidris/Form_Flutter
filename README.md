# About the application

This is a simple contact form app built using the Flutter framework. It allows users to input their name, phone number, and email address, and provides real-time validation to ensure the information is entered correctly.

The key features of this app are:

1. **Contact Form**: The app displays a form with three text fields - one each for name, phone number, and email address.

2. **Input Validation**: As the user types into the text fields, the app validates the input to ensure it meets the required format. For example, the phone number field only accepts numeric characters, and the email field checks for a valid email address format.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**: If the user enters invalid data, the app displays a custom snackbar at the bottom of the screen to provide feedback and help the user correct their input.

4. **Undo Functionality**: The app includes an "Undo" button that allows the user to restore the previous values in the text fields, in case they made a mistake while entering the information.

5. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both mobile and desktop devices, with a clean and intuitive user interface.

This app demonstrates how to handle user input, validate data, and provide visual feedback to the user - all essential skills for building robust and user-friendly mobile apps.
